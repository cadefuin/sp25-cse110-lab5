## Check Your Understanding
1. No; many tests would be needed to test all the different components of the "message" feature, such as typing and sending, as well as all the unique cases for each component.
2. Yes; testing the "max message length" is very small scale and focused on a single functionality (prevent the user from typing more than 80 characters).
